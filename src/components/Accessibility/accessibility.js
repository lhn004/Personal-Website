            <span className="accDesc">This portfolio website showcases my skills, experiences, and projects as a developer. 
                Ensuring it is accessible is essential because the audience includes a diverse range of users—potential employers, collaborators, and peers—some of whom may rely on assistive technologies. 
                An accessible website demonstrates inclusive design thinking and aligns with professional and ethical standards in web development. 
                It also reflects my commitment to building technology that is usable by everyone, regardless of ability.
